# Expandable/Collapsible Menu System (ECMS) 2001

This is an old javascript I did. It has its merits — working in Netscape 4 for one — but isn't accessible without javascript and is a lot more coding than required (takes a little longer to download). You might prefer the [accessible expand/collapse menu](https://github.com/bboyle/xc) I put together. I know I do!
